The dark side of payment processing is fraud.  Between 2018 and 2020 fraud went from a $5.3 billion dollar a year loss to $7.2 billion dollar a year loss.  Fraud hurts your bottom line in more ways than just theft.  Your name and reputation is negatively impacted.  Your customers lose faith in your ability to keep their financial transactions safe and private.  This leads to loss of customers. Your business also losses money in the way of inventory, and charge back fees.  Charge backs occur when the victim of fraud discovers the attack and calls their bank.  When the bank clears the transaction, the funds are removed from your accounts and are given back to the victim.  The bank also charges a fee to the company that originated the charge.  If merchandise was involved in the transaction, then you are deprived of your original transaction, the chargeback fee, and any merchandise or time that was exchanged in the process.

The industry has been fighting fraud since online payments first started.  The primary way to detect fraud is through a rear-view mirror approach.  An attack happens, and payment processors discover the method and add safe guards.  The fraud detection systems have gotten very mature, but they are always chasing after the crooks.  How do we get in front of this problem?
