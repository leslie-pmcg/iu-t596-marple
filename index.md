## Threats to the FinTech industry

The dark side of payment processing is fraud.  Between 2018 and 2020 fraud went from a $5.3 billion dollar a year loss to $7.2 billion dollar a year loss.  Fraud hurts your bottom line in more ways than just theft.  Your name and reputation is negatively impacted.  Your customers lose faith in your ability to keep their financial transactions safe and private.  This leads to loss of customers. Your business also losses money in the way of inventory, and charge back fees.  Charge backs occur when the victim of fraud discovers the attack and calls their bank.  When the bank clears the transaction, the funds are removed from your accounts and are given back to the victim.  The bank also charges a fee to the company that originated the charge.  If merchandise was involved in the transaction, then you are deprived of your original transaction, the chargeback fee, and any merchandise or time that was exchanged in the process.

The industry has been fighting fraud since online payments first started.  The primary way to detect fraud is through a rear-view mirror approach.  An attack happens, and payment processors discover the method and add safe guards.  The fraud detection systems have gotten very mature, but they are always chasing after the crooks.  How do we get in front of this problem?

## Threat Vectors

The threat vectors in the FinTech industry come from many places.  Due to the nature of FinTech, they are dealing with very real assets.  The money and finances that are enabled via FinTech represent actual dollars.  The malactors in this space run the gamut from script kiddes, to hackers, hacking groups, and even state sponsored units looking to disrupt the industry for money, and policical gains.

We've seen a rise in Malware and Virus.  This power tools are aimed at damaging any company's smooth running functions and causing financial losses.  Virus and Malware threaten online shoping.  The group FIN6 has been very active in this space with attacks on well known eCommerce merchants using malware.

Ransomware is another key element in the hackers toolkit.  The number of organizations that paid the ransom on data increated from 26% in 2020 ton 32% in 2021, even though fewer than one in 10 managed to get back all of their data.  Remediation costs, including business downtime, lost orders, operational costs, and more, grew from an average of $761,106 in 2020 to $1.8 million in 2021.  Experts estimate that a ransomware attack will occur every 11 seconds in 2021!

Hackers are directly targeting the infrastructure of Fintech companies by exploiting external facing resources.  In 2021, t-mobile was targeted with such an attack.  The hacker was able to gain access to a network device that was used for testing.  Since the device was supposed to be used for testing it wasn't properly secured and monitored.  The hacker was able to then jump networks from the test network into the internal private network.  Over a matter of weeks the hacker quietly gained access to several databases and exfiltrated over 50 million customer records!

Other resources that are under attact are payment gateways, mobile devices, digital wallets, mobile apps and so on.  The recources are often connected to cloud services.  Cloud services themselves are under continuous attack.  Things like botnets, cloud sprawl and insider attacks all make services there vulnerable.

Phishing scams are another way that hackers can target the FinTech industry.  In particular the end users of financial services are targeted in such a way as to retrieve username, passwords, and other sensitive data.  Hackers can use this data to steal assets from the end user.  They can also use that data to can elevated access into the organization and cause even greater harm.
