# Fintech Industry Threat Models

The Fintech Industry is like any other High-tech business.  There are critical assets that need to be protected!

## Critical Assets

The common components in any high-tech business are:

* Networks
* Compute Resources
    * Customer facing websites
    * Customer facing applications
    * Backoffice applications
    * API Servers
* Data
    * Customer (PII) Databases
    * Application Databases
    * Transaction Data
    * Files
    * Trade Secrets
* Source Code for applications

One of the industry standards in cybersecurity is to model out threats with the "Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis".  

There are many critical assets that could be targeted by attackers.  The above list is only a start.  We have focused in even further on the following assets:

* Network
* OS and Applications
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* Database
* Source Code

### Marple AI!

AI is how we get in front of fraud.  AI and Machine Learning (ML) provide us with the ability to process data at a rate that humans simply can't compete with.  With Marple you will have access to state of the art AI.  Using a variety of methods such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) we can train AI to detect fraud.  We can even train fraud detection AI in ways to catch adversaries in ways they haven't even though of yet.  Of course humans are still a critical part of this process, so Marple also included fraud detention that is trained by the subject matter experts with in your business.
